      <h1>What causes all the natural disasters in haiti?</h1>
        <p>
          Haiti’s geographic location is in the path of Atlantic hurricanes, combined with the steep topography of its western region from which all 
          major river systems flow to the coast, makes the country particularly vulnerable to hydrometeorological disasters, especially between June and December. 
          Landslides are common along all river valleys where years of deforestation have left the upper reaches of the western basins bare. The major natural hazards 
          that threaten Haiti are cyclones, floods, droughts, and landslides, with floods leading as the greatest threat and contributor to vulnerability. 
          The country’s most populated cities are all nestled in the valleys along the coast. When it rains, the steep, often barren hills that surround them flush rainwater 
          toward the urban areas. Widespread deforestation in the upper reaches of these valleys, coupled with lacking drainage infrastructure, creates an environment conducive to flooding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Haiti also sits on a fault line between huge tectonic plates. 
          These two plates are the North American plate and the Caribbean plate. <br />
